          <p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
             It is owned by Oracle, and more than <span class="bold">3 Billion</span> devices run Java.
             It is used for: Mobile applications (specially Android apps), Desktop applications, Web applications,
             Web servers and application servers, Games, Database connections, And much much more!</p>

             <p><br>Some pcs might have java already installed. To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC,

          </header>
          <p>
            An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.
            Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. Development tools often
            include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms. Without an IDE, a developer must select,
            deploy, integrate and manage all of these tools separately. An IDE brings many of those development-related
            tools together as a single framework, application or service. The integrated toolset is designed to simplify
            software development and can identify and minimize coding mistakes and typos. Some IDEs are open source,
            while others are commercial offerings. An IDE can be a standalone application or it can be part of a larger
            package.<br><br>
            An IDE typically contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, accessed through a single
            graphical user interface (GUI). The user writes and edits source code in the code editor. The compiler
            translates the source code into a readable language that is executable for a computer. And the debugger tests
            the software to solve any issues or bugs. An IDE can also contain features such as programmable editors,
            object and data modeling, unit testing, a source code library and build automation tools. An IDE's toolbar
            looks much like a word processor's toolbar. The toolbar facilitates color-based organization, source-code
            formatting, error diagnostics and reporting, and intelligent code completion. Through an IDE's interface,
            a developer or team of developers can compile and execute code incrementally and manage changes to source code
            in a uniform manner. IDEs are typically designed to integrate with third-party version control libraries,
            such as GitHub and Apache's Subversion. An IDE can support model-driven development (MDD).
            A developer working with an IDE starts with a model, which the IDE translates into suitable code.
            The IDE then debugs and tests the model-driven code, with a high level of automation. Once the build is
            successful and properly tested, it can be deployed for further testing through the IDE or other tools outside
            of the IDE.<br><br>

            My personal recommendation, as far as Java IDES are concerned, would be Eclipse.  There are multiple different
            versions of the Eclipse IDE so make sure to read through and find the IDE you feel fits your needs.

          </header>
          <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p><br>
          <div class="code-well">
            <div class="white-well">
              <code>type variable = value;</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variable is the name of the
            variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
            To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:
          </p>
          <div class="code-well">
            <div class="white-well">
              <code>String name = "James";<br> System.out.println(name);</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:</p><br>
          <div class="code-well">
            <div class="white-well">
              <code>int num = 25;<br> System.out.println(num);</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>This will be the format for declaring any of the 8 different data types as variables.</p>

        <section id="Variable_Scope" class="main-section">
          <header id="variable-scope" class="section-header">
            <h3>Variable Scope:</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The scope of a variable defines the section of the code in which the variable is visible.
             As a general rule, variables that are defined within a block are not accessible outside that block.
             The lifetime of a variable refers to how long the variable exists before it is destroyed.
             Destroying variables refers to deallocating the memory that was allotted to the variables when declaring
             it. We have written a few classes till now. You might have observed that not all variables are the same.
             The ones declared in the body of a method were different from those that were declared in the class itself.
             There are there types of variables: instance variables, formal parameters or local variables and local
             variables.
           </p><br>
           <h6 class="section-header">Instance variables:</h6>
           <p>Instance variables are those that are defined within a class itself and not in any method or constructor
             of the class. They are known as instance variables because every instance of the class (object) contains
             a copy of these variables. The scope of instance variables is determined by the access specifier that is
             applied to these variables. We have already seen about it earlier. The lifetime of these variables is the
             same as the lifetime of the object to which it belongs. Object once created do not exist for ever.
             They are destroyed by the garbage collector of Java when there are no more reference to that object.
             We shall see about Java's automatic garbage collector later on.
           </p>

           <h6 class="section-header">Argument variables:</h6><br>
           <p>These are the variables that are defined in the header oaf constructor or a method. The scope of these
             variables is the method or constructor in which they are defined. The lifetime is limited to the time for
             which the method keeps executing. Once the method finishes execution, these variables are destroyed.
           </p>
           <h6 class="section-header">Local variables:</h6>
           <p>A local variable is the one that is declared within a method or a constructor (not in the header).
             The scope and lifetime are limited to the method itself. One important distinction between these three
             types of variables is that access specifiers can be applied to instance variables only and not to argument
             or local variables. In addition to the local variables defined in a method, we also have variables that
             are defined in bocks life an if block and an else block. The scope and is the same as that of the block
             itself. </p>

        <section id="Imports" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h3 class="section-header">Imports:</h3>
          </header>
          <p>import declarations (not statements) are essentially short-hand enabler at the source code level: it allows you to refer to a type or a static member using a single identifier (e.g. List, min) as opposed to the fully qualified name (e.g. java.util.List, Math.min).
            import declaration section is a compile-time element of the source codes, and has no presence at run-time.
            In JVM bytecodes, type names are always fully qualified, and unless you're using a poorly written compiler,
            the binary should only contain names for types that are actually being used.
            Class loaders are used for an entirely different concept, and has nothing to do with import feature at all.
          </p><br>
          <p>An import declaration allows a static member or a named type to be referred to by a simple name that consists of a single identifier. Without the use of an appropriate import declaration, the only way to refer to a type declared in another package, or a static member of another type, is to use a fully qualified name.
            A single-type-import declaration imports a single named type, by mentioning its canonical name.
            A type-import-on-demand declaration imports all the accessible types of a named type or package as needed.
            It is a compile time error to import a type from the unnamed package.
            A single static import declaration imports all accessible static members with a given name from a type,
            by giving its canonical name.
            A static-import-on-demand declaration imports all accessible static members of a named type as needed.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">Classes:</h3><br>
          </header>
          <p>A class is nothing but a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its
            properties and behaviors. Java class objects exhibit the properties and behaviors defined by its class.
            A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.
            Methods are nothing but members of a class that provide a service for an object or perform
            some business logic. Java fields and member functions names are case sensitive. Current states of a
            classâ€™s corresponding object are stored in the objectâ€™s instance variables. Methods define the operations
            that can be performed in java programming.</p><br>
            <p>Below is an example showing the Objects and Classes of the Cube class that defines 3 fields namely
              length, breadth and height. Also the class contains a member function getVolume().

          <p>A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
            When you call the System.out.println() method, for example, the system actually executes several statements
            in order to display a message on the console. Now you will learn how to create your own methods with or
            without return values, invoke a method with or without parameters, and apply method abstraction in the
            program design.

          <h6 class="section-header">Method calling:</h6><br>
          <p>For using a method, it should be called. There are two ways in which a method is called i.e.,
            method returns a value or returning nothing (no return value). The process of method calling is simple.
            When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the called method. This called
            method then returns control to the caller in two conditions, when either the return statement is executed
            or it reaches the method ending close bracket.</p><br>
