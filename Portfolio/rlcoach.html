        <p class="right-panel-content">Heya m8s! I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtNLB3ezB66zADkqHct166w?view_as=subscriber">TheOriginalChboi</a>
        and I am here to coach any players who are interested in the game of Rocket League! I have been playing Rocket League
        since season 1 and I have logged over <span>5000 hours</span> divided between custom training, free play, ranked matches, tournamets,
        casual play as well as any game mode you can imagine. I have played with and against some of the best players to play the game.
        If I didn't have a video of it you might not believe me but I have actually played against and beaten the one and only
        Jstn who plays for the widely known E-sports team "NRG". I started releasing Rocket League videos almost a year ago and I have worked up to my
        12th montage on top of many other Rocket League videos. I have personally won 1v1 tournaments, played in Gfinity tournaments against the best
        and even played with lachinio on the Mock-it League twitch channel many years ago. At my peak I was rated as being in the top < 1% of all players.
        It is for these reasons I am confident in saying that I am more than qualified to coach any player seeking mentorship on the ins and outs of
        outplaying your RL opponents.</p>
